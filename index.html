      <h2>Andi asked me to send over samples of my work to show the team.</h2>
      <h3>In my experience, clients and companies I have worked with in the past tend to respond more to custom work than to some website I had created for a florist- in the Bronx- in the 2000's.</h3>
      <p>That said, here are the beginnings of my reimagined Axcess Worldwide homepage. It was created in its entirety last night. As noted above, the brand slider took up a majority of my time. Even if you are thinking of taking this redesign in a completely different direction, this mockup gives you an idea of the level of work I can do in a fairly tight time frame. Not to mention the code is entirely custom and super clean. You can view it <a href="https://github.com/juniorSE7EN/axcess_worldwide">here</a> on Github.</p>
      <p>I can continue working on this, or send you a legitimate portfolio this weekend if this mockup doesn't display my talents sufficiently. I'd like to think it does. Then again, I WAS working on it at 3am.</p>
      <h3 class="bullets">Bulletpoints</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Currently a front-end Software Engineer at Angelrush Ventures in SF.</li>
        <li>Most days are spent writing highly scalable javascript.</li>
        <li>Highly scalable is a hip phrase in the engineering sector of SF at the moment. Figured I would throw it in here.</li>
        <li>Previously worked at <a href="http://www.ign.com/">IGN</a> as a front-end developer.</li>
        <li>Expert in javascript, html and css on the client. Node JS, Rails and PHP on the server. Mario Cart 64 on Nintendo 64.</li>
        <li>The brand slider was built with a combination of javascript (Backbone.js) and CSS.</li>
        <li>Most of the code I have written over the past few years has been proprietary, which is why I chose to create something custom for YOU!</li>
        <li>I CAN link you to that florist website from '09 if need be though.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Look forward to working with you!</p>
